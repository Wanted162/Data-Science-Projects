#A. Title - Profit Prediction Model

B. Obejctive - Predict Profit using the dataset

C. Models and libraries used :
1.import pandas as pd
2.import numpy as np
3.import seaborn as sns
4.import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
5.from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
6.from sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error
7.from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
8.from math import sqrt
